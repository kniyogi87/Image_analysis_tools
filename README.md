# Extracting information/ statistics from experimental images

Computational fluid dynamics often requires a virtual geometry representing the physical system to simulate the process physics. Accurate virtual geometry is often 
reconstructed from images of real-life experimental systems (eg. cross-sectional scans of surfaces, microscopic images for reaction interfaces). 
Also, such simulations require validation of computed flow physics with experimentally collected images (eg. PIV, LDA). 
In short, computational modeling of physical systems may need some help from the image-processing domain from time-to-time.  
This project looks into a bunch of such algorithms that help us extract meaningful statistics and information from experimental images.
